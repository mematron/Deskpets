This is a collection of Mac OS9 applications from 1999.  I experimented in creating programs that looked literally looked like their name.  I was playing around with "WDEF" resources that OS9 used and hacked them with ResEdit.  Their base code was written in Xojo, the spiritual successor to Visual BASIC and formally called, RealBasic.  

Since these apps only run in OS9 and/or Classic, thus making the likelihood of running them on a modern Macintosh impossible, I've included a video of them working.

If you do get the chance to run them in their native environment have fun!
