# Deskpets
This is a collection of Mac OS9 applications from 1999.  It was an experiment in creating programs that looked like what they were called.  These were created to later become interactive desktop avatars.  Since they only run in OS9 and/or Classic, thus making the likelihood of running them on a modern Macintosh I've included a video of them in a launched state.  However, If you do get the chance to run them in their native environment have fun!
